# *Animatable Class Conception*

1. ___Logic___
	- To every animatable object a folder must be provided 
	in which will be the following:
	
			- All animations included in the file "object-animations"
			- A text file named "animation-info" which will provide the names of animations files liked with engine-internal names
		
			Example of folder path:
				->animationFolder->object-animations/animation-info
			
			Engine-internal animations names:
				1. Walking - walk.png
				2. Running - run.png
				3. Idle - idle.png
